# java OOP basics

## Task 1 
• Create a package: `com.itacademy.java.oop.basics` 

• Create a class: `Employee` which has fields: name, surname, contract type(Full-Time, Part-Time), contract start date, salary and position. 

• Create a class `EmployeeManager` which has main method. 

• Create an `Employee` object in `EmployeeManager`. Fill out all fields with data. 

• Print all employee information. 

### Requirements: 
• Employee should have constructors (with-args, without-args). 

• Use encapsulation. 

• Use enum where it‘s needed (enum contents must have display values and a method to create enum from display value). 

• To print out all information create method in `Employee` class and call it from `EmployeeManager`.


## Task 2 
• Create a package, name: `com.itacademy.java.oop.basics` 

• Create three classes: `Customer`, `Loan and LoansApplication`. 

• `Customer` has fields: name, surname, age, personal number. 

• `Loan` has fields: id, amount, loan type (leasing, consumer loan) and termination date. 

• `LoansApplication` has: main method. 

• Create `Customer` object in `LoansApplication` and fill out all fields with data.

• Add two created loans to customer. Calculate both loans amount and print out information about customer and his loans including both loans amount. 

### Requirements: 
• Use constructors (with-args, without-args). 

• Use encapsulation. 

• Use array for customer loans. 

• Use enum where it‘s needed. 

• To print out all information create method


## Task 3 
• Create a package, name: `com.itacademy.java.oop.basics` 

• Create two classes: `Square` and `ShapeApplication`. 

• `Square` has fields: length and width of Double type 

• `ShapeApplication` has: main method. 

• Create `Square` objects (more than one) in `ShapeApplication` and fill out all fields with data. Store shapes in an array. 

• Iterate through the array of the shapes and check if shape is valid (values are not negative) if any of the value is negative print them out. For valid shapes calculate area and perimeter and print it out. 

### Requirements: 
• Use constructors (with-args, without-args). 

• Use encapsulation. 

• Calculation must be done using methods. 

• To print out all information create the method 

## Additional Task 4: 
- write a Java application to check whether a string is a valid password. 

Password rules: 

• A password must have at least ten characters. 
	
• A password consists of only letters and digits. 
	
• A password must contain at least two digits.

• Your own rules??????*** 


Input : `qwerty123456`
